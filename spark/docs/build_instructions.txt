This project makes use of several other xdata projects. You must build and install each 
prior to building the SparkMicroPath Project.

OCULUS:

There are two classes that I am making use of that have hard coded values containing cluster connection information in them.  If you are not working on the xdata cloud you will need to modify these classes prior to building.  This is a temporary work around, in future releases these classes will be configurable wihout the need to modify source and rebuild.

To build and install oclus packages perform the folloing

navigate to gitxdata/tools/visualizations/oculus/aperture/oculus-common

mvn clean package install

navigate to gitxdata/tools/visualizations/oculus/aperture/demos/xdata/SC2013/Spark

SPARK:

You also need to compile against your version of spark.  You can download spark from
http://spark.incubator.apache.org/downloads.html
